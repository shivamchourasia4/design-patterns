# Use the Factory Pattern when:

- The exact type of object isn't known until runtime.

- You want to decouple object creation from usage.

- You need to encapsulate object creation logic.

## Key points

- Client doesnâ€™t know or care about the concrete class.

- Easy to extend: add new shapes without changing client code, just update factory.
